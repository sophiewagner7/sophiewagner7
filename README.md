# Hi, I'm Sophie Wagner

I'm a data science graduate student with a background in health analytics, machine learning, and Python-based research tools. I'm passionate about graph learning, reproducibility, and building tools that make data more accessible.

## Projects

### Anti-Money Laundering Detection (Columbia MSDS Capstone Project)
> [`dsi-capstone-spring-2025-TD-anti-money-laundering`](https://github.com/engi4800/dsi-capstone-spring-2025-TD-anti-money-laundering)  
Built a Graph Neural Network pipeline to detect suspicious financial transactions. Compared GNN performance with XGBoost + engineered graph features. Developed modular PyTorch codebase and real-time evaluation tools.

### Colorectal Cancer in the Dominican Republic (CUIMC)
> [`dr-crc-calibration`](https://github.com/sophiewagner7/dr-crc-calibration)
Calibration for the natural history of colorectal cancer to U.S. SEER data, DR GCO estimates, and DR hospital data. For use in Markov cohort screening model.

### Pancreatic Cancer Screening for New-Onset Diabetes Patients (CUIMC)
> [`pdac-calibration`](https://github.com/sophiewagner7/pdac-calibration)
Calibration for the natural history of pancreatic cancer in new-onset diabetes patients for use in Markov decision-analytic screening model.

### It's Too Nice Out to Take a Cab (Columbia MSDS Assignment - Data Viz)
> [`its-too-nice-out-to-take-a-cab`](https://github.com/sophiewagner7/its-too-nice-out-to-take-a-cab)
Data visualization and github site creation practice. Analysis of NYC taxi data. R, HTML, D3.

### Survival analysis 
> [`surv-analysis-R`](https://github.com/sophiewagner7/surv-analysis-R)
Educational template for carrying out survival analysis in R. Overview of `survminer`, `ggsurvplot`, `tidycmprsk`, and other packages for Kaplan-Meier, CIF, Cox PH, and Fine-Gray competing risk models.
